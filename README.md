- **Eye Gaze Tracking**: Advanced calibration system for precise gaze detection
- **Multiple Communication Modes**:
  - Response selection from AI-generated options
  - Letter-by-letter spelling interface
  - Voice recording and transcription
  - Scheduled question reminders
- **AI Integration**: Uses OpenAI GPT and semantic similarity for intelligent response generation
- **Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs voice cloning for personalized speech output
- **Emergency Support**: Automated email alerts to caregivers
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive models for improved gaze accuracy

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows 11 (tested on Lenovo Thinkpad E15 Gen 3, 16GB RAM)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Webcam**: Required for eye tracking
- **Microphone**: Required for voice input

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Visionbridge-Published-Code-POC
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
   ELEVEN_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   OPENAI_FINE_TUNED_API_KEY=your_openai_fine_tuned_key
   ```

   **Required API Keys:**
   - **Supabase**: For data storage and retrieval ([Get API keys](https://supabase.com))
   - **ElevenLabs**: For voice synthesis ([Get API key](https://elevenlabs.io))
   - **OpenAI**: For AI response generation ([Get API key](https://openai.com))
   - **Gmail App Password**: For emergency email notifications ([Setup guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833))

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üìñ How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. **Camera Positioning**: Position your webcam at eye level for optimal tracking
2. **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting on your face
3. **Calibration**: Follow the on-screen calibration process:
   - Look up, center, and down when prompted
   - Look at the calibration points that appear on screen
   - The system will learn your eye movement patterns

### Communication Modes

#### 1. Response Selection Mode
- Ask a question using voice (press Space bar) or through the scheduling interface
- The system generates 4 response options using AI
- Look at the screen region containing your desired response
- Hold your gaze for 3+ seconds to select

#### 2. Spelling Mode
- Look at the top-left corner to enter spelling mode
- Letters are divided into quadrants on the screen
- Look at the quadrant containing your desired letter
- Continue narrowing down until you select individual letters
- Build words letter by letter

#### 3. Voice Input
- Press the Space bar to activate voice recording
- Speak your question clearly
- The system will transcribe and generate response options

#### 4. Scheduled Questions
- Use the GUI interface to schedule recurring questions
- Set specific times or countdown timers
- Questions can repeat daily for routine check-ins

### Screen Regions

The interface is divided into regions for gaze-based interaction:
- **Top**: Response option 1
- **Left**: Response option 2  
- **Bottom**: Response option 3
- **Right**: Response option 4
- **Top-left corner**: Enter spelling mode
- **Top-right corner**: Emergency help (sends alert email)

### Keyboard Controls

- **Space**: Start voice recording
- **Q**: Quit application

## üîß Configuration

### Emergency Contact Setup
Configure emergency email notifications by setting the recipient email in the application. When the top-right corner is selected, an alert email is automatically sent to caregivers.

### Voice Customization
The system supports ElevenLabs voice cloning for personalized speech output. Configure your preferred voice through the ElevenLabs API settings.

### AI Response Tuning
Adjust response generation parameters in the code:
- `similarity_threshold`: Controls relevance of database responses (default: 0.55)
- `diversity_threshold`: Ensures response variety (default: 0.7)
- `top_n`: Number of response options (default: 4)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not detected**
- Ensure webcam is connected and not used by other applications
- Check camera permissions in Windows settings

**Poor eye tracking accuracy**
- Recalibrate the system
- Improve lighting conditions
- Ensure camera is at eye level
- Minimize head movement during use

**API connection errors**
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Check internet connection
- Confirm API key validity and quotas

**Voice recognition issues**
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Ensure microphone is working and not muted
- Check for background noise interference
